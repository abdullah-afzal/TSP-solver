mMMAS-LKH:
  This follows the modified-acotsp with an LKH local search approach.
  The results were generated by iteratively running two codes, with the
  acotsp code first and the LKH code last.
  The instancename.ant.tour file generated by the acotsp code becomes
  the input for the LKH code. The instancename.tour file generated by
  the LKH code becomes the input for the acotsp code.

  Specifically, the last geneated instancename.ant.tour is in this directory. 
  The optimal tour should be reached by using: 

	./LKH instancename.par

  The result should be comparible to the corresponding file at the directory
  mMMAS-LKHresult

  To use acotsp, it is useful to use -b 1 and -e 0.5 options to increase the
  diversity. it is important to remember to use -j in acotsp.

  Only four difficult TSPs are included here.
