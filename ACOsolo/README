The modified acotsp code can optionally read in instancename.tour file
as generation_best (or ancestor_best in the code). The tour file will not 
be used in pheromone update in MMAS (-x) or ACS (-z), but will be used in
mMMAS (-n) and mMMAS-LKH (-j).

To get the best of all AS options, one can use:

  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -z
  cp instancename.ant.tour instancename.tour
  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -x
  cp instancename.ant.tour instancename.tour
  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -n

Please note that the user must manually check the tour length and choose
the best output instancename.ant.tour among all those calculations.
The specific results can be found in directory ACOresult

To check those results, use command line:

  grep "LENGTH" ACOresult/*.tour

-->The first column of Table I.
