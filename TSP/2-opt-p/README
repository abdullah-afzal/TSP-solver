2-opt-p

Implementation of probability-based 2-opt (2-opt-p).

This code uses two constrinsts, delta1=0.05 and delta2=0.1 (in ls.c) in 
order to avoid the convergence problems, since the excution time increases
drastically with smaller values. 

The modified acotsp code can optionally read in instancename.tour file
as generation_best (or ancestor_best in the code). The tour file will not 
be used in pheromone update in MMAS (-x) or ACS (-z), but will be used in
mMMAS (-n) and mMMAS-LKH (-j).

To get the best of all AS options, one can use:

  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -l 4 -z
  cp instancename.ant.tour instancename.tour
  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -l 4 -x
  cp instancename.ant.tour instancename.tour
  ./acotsp -i instancename.tsp -l 4 -n

Please note that the user must manually check the tour length and choose
the best output instancename.ant.tour among all those calculations. The 
specific results can be found in the directory 2optpresult

To check those results, use command line:

  grep LENGTH 2optpresult/*.tour
