QnD:
  This follows the quick-and-dirty ACO approach. The command to run 
  the code is
        ./LKH instancename.par
  In the filename.par file, there is the line:
  INPUT_TOUR_FILE = instancename.ant.tour
  The instancename.ant.tour file can be generated from the acotsp code.
  The output of this code is an instancename.tour file.

  The latest tests indicate that two TSP instances fl1577 and u1817, which 
  LKHsolo did not solve to optimality, can be solved by QnD using the 
  ACOsolo generated fl1577.ant.tour and u1817.ant.tour, respectively.

    grep Length QnDresult/*.tour

  All four instances that the LKHsolo was unable to solve to optimality, can
  be solved by iterative approach mMMAS-LKH.
